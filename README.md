Concept social posting app - twitter bootstrap / FuelUX / Backbone / Facebook API / RSS

Sample application using FuelUX, bootstrap, & backbone

What it does:
This app facilitates scheduling of images from RSS feeds to randomly post on a facebook or twitter page.

Workflow: Select --> Moderate

The data is real and the app is fully data-driven. The main workflow is mostly functional, albeit simplified. 
The app was built from the ground up based on an idea that I had about improving the speed as which I could 
process interesting image-based content for social propagation.  PHP and MySQL is used on the backend.
